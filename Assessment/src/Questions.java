//Aapli Taxi is a taxi cab operator. They have 3 types of cars - Mini, Sedan and SUV, each with a different tariff.
//Find the cost of travel ‘c’ given the following inputs: the selection of type of car - 'n', and the distance traveled 'x'.
//The type of car 'n' can take the values 1, 2, or 3 - which corresponds to Mini, Sedan and SUV respectively.
//The distance covered 'x' can be any natural number value.
//	                      Mini Sedan SUV
//Base Distance (in kms)	3	5	5
//Base Price (in Rs)		50	80	100
//Above Base Distance price per km (in Rs)	10	12	15
//
//	Mini	Sedan	SUV
//Milestone Distance (in kms)	75	100	NA
//Price per km after milestone distance (in Rs)	8	10	NA
//
//The fare that the customer has to pay will vary depending on the type of car chosen and the distance travelled. The price for distance travelled is also broken down into multiple slabs as indicated in the table.
//For example, if the input is 10 km, then in case of Mini, first base distance fare of Rs 50 for 3 kms will be applicable and for the remaining 7 kms, the fare will be 7 x 10 = Rs 70. The total fare will be Rs 120.
//Another example, is if input is 120 km, then in case of Sedan, since the distance is more than the Milestone distance, the base price will not be applicable. The milestone pricing will be applicable which makes the fare 120 x 10 = Rs 1200.
//
//Test cases
//Input – Type of car (n)	Input – Distance (x)	Output – Cost (c)
//1	20	220
//2	25	260
